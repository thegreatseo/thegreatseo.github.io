## Hello!

I am a PhD student in mathematics working in **extremal combinatorics** and **graph theory**, with a particular interest in **graph homomorphism inequalities**.

I am currently at [Yonsei University]({{ site.affiliation_link }}), supervised by [Joonkyung Lee](https://sites.google.com/site/joonkyungleemaths/). I got a Bachelor's in Mathematics at [Pohang University of Science and Technology](https://math.postech.ac.kr/en/).




<!-- ## Research Interests -->

<!-- - **Computer Vision:** image recognition, image generation, video captioning
- **Machine Learning:** meta-learning, incremental learning, transfer learning -->

## News

I am visiting [Caltech](https://www.pma.caltech.edu/research-and-academics/mathematics) from January to July 2026, hosted by [David Conlon](https://www.its.caltech.edu/~dconlon/).

During my visit, I’ll be in the U.S. and would be happy to consider invitations for seminars or research meetings; please feel free to contact me.
